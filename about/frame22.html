        Uttar Pradesh faces the warmth of the sun during the summer season.
        Starting in the month of April and lasting till June, the state experiences extreme temperature. The average
        temperature ranges between 25°C and 45°C. The days are extremely warm with temperature touching 48°C in many
        parts of the state experiencing heat waves. The nights are relatively moderate with temperature slightly dipping
        to 28-32°C. Although the state experiences a fair amount of tourist footfall, the season is not suitable for a
        day excursion.
        Although, it gets relatively cooler as we move from Western Uttar Pradesh to Eastern Pradesh, the region of
        Central Uttar Pradesh witnesses average day temperature of 42°C to 45°C during the month of May and June. The
        nights are humid too. Although not the most suited time to visit Uttar Pradesh, the visitors can explore summer
        getaways and popular tourist attractions like Taj Mahal in Agra, Monuments in Lucknow and Sangam in Prayagraj.
        Ghats of Varanasi are also some of the best.
