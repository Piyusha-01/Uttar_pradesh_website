        Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian Monsoon is the major bearer of rain in
        most parts of U.P. It is the South-West Monsoon which brings most of the rain here, although rain due to the
        western disturbances and North-East Monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation
        of the state. The rain in U.P. can vary from an annual average of 170 cm in hilly areas to 84 cm in Western U.P.
        Given the concentration of most of this rainfall in the 4 months of Monsoon period, excess rain can lead to
        floods and shortage to droughts. As such these two phenomenons of floods and droughts are a common recurrence in
        the state.
