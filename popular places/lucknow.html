            is the replica of that protective grill or structure which is kept on the grave of Imam Husain at Karbala,
            Iraq. The large green and white bordered hall of Azakhana is richly decorated with chandeliers and a good
            number of crystal glass lamp-stands. In fact, it was for this profuse decoration that the Imambara was

            decorated with Quranic verses in Islamic calligraphy .
