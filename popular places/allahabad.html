            Officially known as <i> ALLAHABAD</i>, also known as Ilahabad, is a metropolis in the
            Indian
            state
            of Uttar Pradesh. It is the administrative headquarters of the Allahabad district—the most populous
            district
            in
            the state and 13th most populous district in India—and the Allahabad division. The city is the judicial
            capital
            of Uttar Pradesh with the Allahabad High Court being the highest judicial body in the state. As of 2011,
            Allahabad is the seventh most populous city in the state, thirteenth in Northern India and thirty-sixth
            in
            India, with an estimated population of 1.53 million in the city.In 2011 it was ranked the world's 40th
            fastest-growing city. Allahabad, in 2016, was also ranked the third most liveable urban agglomeration in
            the state (after Noida and Lucknow) and sixteenth in the country. Hindi is the most widely spoken
            language
            in the city.
            <br>
            Allahabad lies close to Triveni Sangam, the "three-river confluence" of the Ganges, Yamuna and Sarasvati
            rivers.It plays a central role in Hindu scriptures. The city finds its earliest reference as one of the
            world's
            oldest known cities in Hindu mythological texts and has been venerated as the holy city of Prayaga in
            the
            ancient Vedas. Allahabad was also known as Kosambi in the late Vedic period, named by the Kuru rulers of
            Hastinapur, who developed it as their capital. Kosambi was one of the greatest cities in India from the
            late
            Vedic period until the end of the Maurya Empire, with occupation continuing until the Gupta Empire.
            Since
            then,
            the city has been a political, cultural and administrative centre of the Doab region. In the early 17th
            century,
            Allahabad was a provincial capital in the Mughal Empire under the reign of Jahangir.
            <br>
            Akbarnama mentions that the Mughal emperor Akbar founded a great city in Allahabad. Abd al-Qadir
            Badayuni
            and
            Nizamuddin Ahmad mention that Akbar laid the foundations of an imperial city there which was called
            Ilahabas
            or
            Ilahabad.He was said to be impressed by its strategic location and built a fort there, later renaming
            it Ilahabas by 1584, which was changed to Allahabad by Shah Jahan. In 1580, Akbar created the "Subah
            of Ilahabas" with Allahabad as its capital. In mid-1600, Jahangir made an abortive attempt to seize
            Agra's
            treasury and came to Allahabad, seizing its treasury and setting himself up as a virtually independent
            ruler.He was, however, reconciled with Akbar and returned to Allahabad where he stayed before returning
            to
            the royal court in 1604.
            <br>
            In 1833 it became the seat of the Ceded and Conquered Provinces region before its capital was moved to
            Agra
            in
            1835. Allahabad became the capital of the North-Western Provinces in 1858 and was the
            capital of India for a day.The city was the capital of the United Provinces from 1902 to 1920 and
            remained at the forefront of national importance during the struggle for Indian independence.
            <br>
            Located in southern Uttar Pradesh, the city covers 365 km2 (141 sq mi). Although the city and its
            surrounding
            area are governed by several municipalities, a large portion of Allahabad district is governed by the
            Allahabad
            City Council. The city is home to colleges, research institutions and many central and state government
            offices.
            Allahabad has hosted cultural and sporting events, including the Prayag Kumbh Mela and the Indira
            Marathon.
            Although the city's economy was built on tourism, most of its income now derives from real estate and
            financial
            services.
