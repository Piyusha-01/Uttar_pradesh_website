            An important Buddhist site in India, Sarnath is a scintillating gem of Uttar Pradesh tourism. Reckoned to be
            the place where Buddha preached his first sermon, Sarnath is a neighbor of Varanasi city. Later magnified by
            Ashoka by the establishment of stupas and monasteries, this city became a popular destination amongst
            Buddhist
            devotees. It is believed that the site disappeared completely in the 12th century but was rediscovered
            during the 19th century by British archeologists. Today, Sarnath is amongst the most important Buddhist
            destinations in India. It is a place located 10 kilometres north-east of Varanasi near the confluence of the
            Ganges and the Varuna
            rivers in Uttar Pradesh, India. The Deer Park in Sarnath is where Gautama Buddha first taught the Dharma,
            and
            where
            the Buddhist Sangha came into existence through the enlightenment of Kondanna.
            Singhpur, a village approximately one kilometre away from the site, was the birthplace of Shreyansanath, the
            Eleventh Tirthankara of Jainism. A temple dedicated to him is an important pilgrimage site.
            Also referred to as Isipatana, this city is mentioned by the Buddha as one of the four places of pilgrimage
            his devout followers should visit. It was also the site of the Buddha's Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which
            was
            his first sermon after attaining enlightenment, in which he explained the four noble truths and the
            teaching associated with them.

        <p>
            It is thought originally to have been built as a terraced temple during the Gupta period
            between the 4th and 6th centuries to mark the site where Buddha and his first disciples met traveling from
            Bodh
            Gaya to Sarnath. Later Govardhan, the son of a Raja Todar Mal, modified the stupa to its present shape by
            building the octagonal tower to commemorate the visit of Humayun, the powerful Mughal ruler.
            Today the stupa is a high earthen mound covered with a brickwork edifice topped by an octagonal tower. It is
            maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.

        <p>
            Situated near the main chowk of Sarnath, where the roads divides, the Mulagandha Kuti Vihar monastery was
            built
            in 1931 with donations from various countries and the international Buddhist community. There are spires on
            top
            of the huge building that make it seem like a church. The Vihara is enshrined with the sacred relics of
            Sakyamuni Buddha. It is open from sunrise to sunset and entry is free.
            It was built by Angarika Dharmapala, who was the founder of Mahabodhi society and is still maintained and
            run by
            the Mahabodhi Society. The building itself is very pretty and the Mulagandha Kuti Vihar has become one of
            Sarnaths greatest attractions for tourists. It is said that the consecration drew devotees from all over the
            world to witness and seek blessings.
            The entrance foyer is decorated by a huge bell that was gifted by Japan and the interior houses a golden
            statue
            of the Buddha on a marble platform. The insides are completely dominated by fresco-covered walls depicting
            scenes from Buddhas life and are made by Japanese artist Kosetsu Nosu and are said to have been completed in
            1936. The frescoes are an excellent source of knowledge if someone is interested in knowing more about life
            of
            the Buddha right from his birth to the attainment of Mahaparinirvana.

            To keep the antiquities found from the site, a decision was taken in 1904 by the Government to construct a
            site
            museum adjacent to the excavated site at Sarnath. It was due to initiative of Sir John Marshall, the then
            Director General of Archaeology in India, that this museum was created. The plans were prepared by Mr. James
            Ramson, the then consulting Architect to the Government of India. The building was completed in 1910 to
            house,
            display and study the antiquities in their right perspective. The building forms half of a monastery
            (Sangharam)
            in plan.

            This is the art and architecture of Buddhist temples in Sarnath. Temples are known as wats, from the Pāḷi
            vāṭa,
            meaning "enclosure." A temple has an enclosing wall that divides it from the secular world.
