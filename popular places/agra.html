            The city of Uttar Pradesh and most popularly known as <i>city of architecture</i>
            Agra has earned itself international fame for being a heritage hotspot in the country. Reflecting the
            architectural excellence of the Mughal Era, Agra stands on the bank of River Yamuna. The Mughal Empire has
            endowed Agra with architectural grandeurs like tombs and mausoleums; forts and palaces; gardens and mosques.
            A creative ground for the art lovers like Akbar, Shah Jahan and even the Lodi rulers, Agra is one such
            destination that alone brings a great boost in Uttar Pradesh tourism.

        Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz. This UNESCO World Heritage Site (and a symbol of
        love, too) is reason enough to visit Agra. Besides the allure of this spectacular white mausoleum, the city
        is home to two more UNESCO World Heritage Sites the 16th-century Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, which are
        just as noteworthy.
        <br>
        Like the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort prior to Mahmud Ghaznavi's invasion is unclear. However, in
        the 15th century, the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when
        Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487 to 1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the
        pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled
        from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of
        Akbar (A.D. 1556 to 1605).

            It was built during 1565-1573 for Mughal Emperor Akbar. It was the main residence of the rulers of Sikarwar
            clan of Rajputs until mughals occupied it and Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from
            Agra to Delhi. It was also known as the “Lal-Qila”, “Fort Rouge” or “Qila-i-Akbari”. Before capture by the
            British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was life
            inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument,
            the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as the walled city.
