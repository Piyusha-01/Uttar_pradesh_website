            It was an ancient city on the Indian subcontinent which was the capital of the clan of the
            Shakyas. King Suddhodana and Queen Maya are believed to have lived at Kapilavastu, as did their son
            Prince
            Siddartha Gautama until he left the palace at the age of 29.

            Buddhist texts such as the Pāli Canon claim that Kapilavastu was the childhood home of Gautama Buddha,
            on
            account of it being the capital of the Shakyas, over whom his father ruled. Kapilavastu is the place
            where
            Siddhartha Gautama spent 29 years of his life. According to Buddhist sources Kapilvastu was named after
            Vedic
            sage Kapila.

        <p>It is a mound-like or hemispherical structure containing relics ( typically the remains of Buddhist monks or
            nuns) that is used as a place of meditation. A related architectural term is a chaitya, which is a prayer
            hall or temple containing a stupa.
            In Buddhism, circumambulation or pradakhshina has been an important ritual and devotional practice since the
            earliest times, and stupas always have a pradakhshina path around them.

            Ganwaria was a residential site. Since Ganwaria is located so close to the Piparahwa Stupa, it becomes clear
            that it is indeed the place Bhagwan Buddha grew up. “A 38-meter square shaped huge building is found at the
            western side of the site which consists of a courtyard of 16.70 square meters.

            Excavation at Salargarh, 200 m. east of Piprahwa, revealed a monastery of Kushana period. The layout of this
            monastery differs from that of Piprahwa. The monastery is approached from the north through a flight of
            steps. A small stupa was also attached to the monastery.
