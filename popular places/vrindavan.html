        <p class="para"> Holding immense religious importance amongst Hindu devotees, Vrindavan is a place where the
            worshippers of Lord Krishna throng to seek the blessing. Dozens of temples, old and modern, dot the town and
            they come in all shapes and sizes holding their own peculiarities and stories. Each temple can be reached by
            narrow winding lanes that are plush with shops that sell worship items and sweets. One thing one has to be
            aware of are monkeys, who practically mug visitors. Visiting UP will be incomplete without exploring
            Vrindavan.</p>

                    <font size="+3">BANKEY BIHARI TEMPLE</font>
                </b></i></li>
        <p>
            The temple is dedicated to Bankey Bihari who is believed to be the combined form
            of Radha and Krishna. Bankey Bihari was originally worshipped at Nidhivan, Vrindavan. Later, when Bankey
            Bihari temple was constructed around 1864, idol of Bankey Bihari was moved to new temple.
            The image of Radha Krishna's united form stands in the Tribhanga posture. Swami Haridas originally
            worshipped this devotional image under the name of Kunj-Bihari ("one who enjoys in the groves (Kunj) of
            Vrindavan").
            Krishna upholding the Govardhan mountain in the Tribhanga pose
            'Bānke' means 'bent', and 'Bihāri' or 'Vihāri' means 'enjoyer'. This is how Kṛiṣhṇa, who is bent in three
            places, got the name "Bānke Bihāri". According to Śrī Brahma-saḿhitā (verse 5.31), Brahma says the following
            about Kṛṣṇa:
            "I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, round whose neck is swinging a garland of flowers beautified with the
            moon-locket, whose two hands are adorned with the flute and jewelled ornaments, who always revels in
            pastimes of love, whose graceful threefold-bending form of Śyāmasundara is eternally manifest.

            Which means "Forest of Tulsi" is one of the sacred forest sites of Vrindavan. It is situated
            in the Mathura district, Uttar Pradesh, India. Nidhivan is considered as the most prominent site
            dedicated to the pastimes of Hindu deities Radha Krishna and their gopis. It is the common belief among
            devotees that Nidhivan still witnesses the Raslila (dance) of Radha and Krishna during night time and thus,
            nobody is allowed to stay inside the premises of Nidhivan at night.

        <p>
            Sri Krishna Balrama Temple is acknowledged for being the first temple constructed by the International
            Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Built in 1975 by the ISKCON cult, the foundation of the
            shrine was laid by Swami Prabhupada (founder of ISKCON) himself. Located at Raman Reti in Vrindavan, the
            temple can be easily reached by regular transport from the western part of Uttar Pradesh. From Delhi,
            one can get in touch with the temple by taking regular buses or by hiring taxis.
            In the vein of other temples made by the society, Sri Krishna Balrama Mandir is too called as Iskcon
            Temple all over. After the original construction, the temple complex has extended evidently, to
            accomplish the vision of Swami Prabhupada, for an international center in Vrindavan. The temple stands
            on the banks of Yamuna River, where Sri Krishna along with Balrama used to herd their cows. The
            magnificent structure of the Iskcon Temple comes across the sight, as and when, one enters the holy
            lands of Vrindavan.

        <p>
            In Vrindavan, on the holy Krishna Janmabhoomi, lies the
            temple that is a must visit destination for devotees completing the 84 kosh Vraj Parikrama Yatra. The
            temple is centuries old and is the first Indian temple that is dedicated to the divine couple and their
            Ashta Sakhis - the eight friends of Radha who were intimately involved in her love play with the Lord
            Krishna. Mention of the Ashta Sakhis are found in the ancient texts of Ramayan and the Srimad Bhagvat.
            The temple is called Shree Radha Ras Behari Ashta Sakhi Mandir and it is home to the divine Ras Leela of
            Lord Krishna and Radharani. It is located in close proximity to the Banke Behari mandir.
            Legend has it that the Shree Radha Ras Behari Ashta Sakhi Mandir is one of the two places in Mathura,
            Vrindavan where the Lord Krishna actually indulges in the Ras Leela with his beloved Radha and her sakhis.
            On these nights, devotees have reported hearing the sound of the anklets, beating in tune to a divine
            melody.
