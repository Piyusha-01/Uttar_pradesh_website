                The city of Uttar Pradesh and most popularly known as <i>city of architecture</i>
                Agra has earned itself international fame for being a heritage hotspot in the country. Reflecting the
                architectural excellence of the Mughal Era, Agra stands on the bank of River Yamuna. The Mughal Empire
                has
                endowed Agra with architectural grandeurs like tombs and mausoleums; forts and palaces; gardens and
                mosques.
                A creative ground for the art lovers like Akbar, Shah Jahan and even the Lodi rulers, Agra is one such

                An important Buddhist site in India, Sarnath is a scintillating gem of Uttar Pradesh tourism. Reckoned
                to be
                the place where Buddha preached his first sermon, Sarnath is a neighbor of Varanasi city. Later
                magnified by
                Ashoka by the establishment of stupas and monasteries, this city became a popular destination amongst
                Buddhist
                devotees. It is believed that the site disappeared completely in the 12th century but was rediscovered
                during the 19th century by British archeologists. Today, Sarnath is amongst the most important Buddhist
                destinations in India.This is a place located 10 kilometres north-east of Varanasi near the confluence
                of the Ganges and the Varuna
                rivers in Uttar Pradesh, India. The Deer Park in Sarnath is where Gautama Buddha first taught the
                Dharma, and where
                the Buddhist Sangha came into existence through the enlightenment of Kondanna.
                Singhpur, a village approximately one kilometre away from the site, was the birthplace of Shreyansanath,
                the
                Eleventh Tirthankara of Jainism. A temple dedicated to him is an important pilgrimage site.
                Also referred to as Isipatana, this city is mentioned by the Buddha as one of the four places of
                pilgrimage
                his devout followers should visit. It was also the site of the Buddha's Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta,
                which was
                his first sermon after attaining enlightenment, in which he explained the four noble truths and the
                teachings associated with them.

                This is a city situated on the banks of holy river Saryu in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It
                is the administrative headquarters of the Faizabad district as well as
                the Faizabad division of Uttar Pradesh, India.It shares a municipal corporation with its neighbouring
                twin city of Faizabad. Ayodhya, also known as <i>Saketa</i>, is an ancient city of India, is the
                birthplace of Rama and setting of the
                great epic Ramayana. Ayodhya used to be the capital of the ancient Kosala Kingdom. It has an average
                elevation of
                93 meters (305 feet). Owing to the belief as the birthplace of Rama, Ayodhya (Awadhpuri) has been
                regarded as
                first one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites (Mokshdayini Sapt Puris) for Hindus.
                The early Buddhist and Jain canonical texts mention that the religious leaders Gautama Buddha and
                Mahavira
                visited and lived in the city. The Jain texts also describe it as the birthplace of five tirthankaras
                namely, Rishabhanatha, Ajitanatha, Abhinandananatha, Sumatinath and Anantnath, and associate it with the
                legendary
                Bharata Chakravarti. From the Gupta period onwards, several sources mention Ayodhya and Saketa as the
                name
                of the same city.
                Owing to the belief as the birthplace of Ram, Ayodhya has been regarded as one of the seven most
                important
                pilgrimage sites for Hindus. It is believed that a temple stood at the supposed birth spot of Rama,
                which
                was demolished by the orders of the Mughal emperor Babur and a mosque erected in its place.In 1992, the
                dispute
                over the spot led to the demolition of mosque by Hindu mobs, who aimed to rebuild a grand temple of Rama
                at
                the site. A five-judge full bench of the Supreme Court heard the title cases from August to October 2019
                and
                ruled that the land belonged to the government per tax records, and ordered it to be handed over to a
                trust
                to build a Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternative 5 acres of land to the
                Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to build a mosque in lieu of the demolished Babri mosque. The
                construction of Ram Mandir commenced in August 2020.

                world's
                oldest known cities in Hindu mythological texts and has been venerated as the holy city of Prayaga in
                the
                ancient Vedas. Allahabad was also known as Kosambi in the late Vedic period, named by the Kuru rulers of
                Hastinapur, who developed it as their capital. Kosambi was one of the greatest cities in India from the
                late
                Vedic period until the end of the Maurya Empire, with occupation continuing until the Gupta Empire.
                Since
                then,
                the city has been a political, cultural and administrative centre of the Doab region. In the early 17th
                century,
                Allahabad was a provincial capital in the Mughal Empire under the reign of Jahangir.
                <br>
                Akbarnama mentions that the Mughal emperor Akbar founded a great city in Allahabad. Abd al-Qadir
                Badayuni
                and
                Nizamuddin Ahmad mention that Akbar laid the foundations of an imperial city there which was called
                Ilahabas
                or
                Ilahabad.He was said to be impressed by its strategic location and built a fort there, later renaming
                it Ilahabas by 1584, which was changed to Allahabad by Shah Jahan. In 1580, Akbar created the "Subah
                of Ilahabas" with Allahabad as its capital. In mid-1600, Jahangir made an abortive attempt to seize
                Agra's
                treasury and came to Allahabad, seizing its treasury and setting himself up as a virtually independent
                ruler.He was, however, reconciled with Akbar and returned to Allahabad where he stayed before returning
                to
                the royal court in 1604.
                <br>
                In 1833 it became the seat of the Ceded and Conquered Provinces region before its capital was moved to
                Agra
                in
                1835. Allahabad became the capital of the North-Western Provinces in 1858 and was the
                capital of India for a day.The city was the capital of the United Provinces from 1902 to 1920 and
                remained at the forefront of national importance during the struggle for Indian independence.
                <br>
                Located in southern Uttar Pradesh, the city covers 365 km2 (141 sq mi). Although the city and its
                surrounding
                area are governed by several municipalities, a large portion of Allahabad district is governed by the
                Allahabad
                City Council. The city is home to colleges, research institutions and many central and state government
                offices.
                Allahabad has hosted cultural and sporting events, including the Prayag Kumbh Mela and the Indira
                Marathon.
                Although the city's economy was built on tourism, most of its income now derives from real estate and
                financial
                services.

            It is a town in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh, India. Situated 37 kms from the
            district
            headquarters Agra, Fatehpur Sikri itself was founded as the capital of Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor
            Akbar,
            serving this role from 1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in Punjab and was later
            completely abandoned in 1610.
            <br>
            The name of the city is derived from the village called Sikri which occupied the spot before. An
            Archaeological
            Survey of India (ASI) excavation from 1999 to 2000 indicated that there was a habitation, temples and
            commercial
            centres here before Akbar built his capital. The region was settled by Sungas following their expansion. It
            was
            controlled by Sikarwar Rajputs from 7th to 16th century CE till the Battle of Khanwa (1527).
            <br>
            The khanqah of Sheikh Salim Chishti existed earlier at this place. Akbar's son Jahangir was born at the
            village
            of Sikri to his consort Mariam-uz-Zamani in 1569 and that year Akbar began construction of a religious
            compound
            to commemorate the Sheikh who had predicted the birth. After Jahangir's second birthday, he began the
            construction of a walled city and imperial palace here. The city came to be known as Fatehpur Sikri, the
            "City
            of Victory", after Akbar's victorious Gujarat campaign in 1573.
            <br>
            After occupying Agra in 1803, the East India Company established an administrative centre here and it
            remained
            so until 1850. In 1815, the Marquess of Hastings ordered repair of monuments at Sikri.
            Fatehpur Sikri was awarded the status of UNESCO World Heritlage Site in 1986.
