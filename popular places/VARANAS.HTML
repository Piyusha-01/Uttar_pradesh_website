            This religious city in Uttar Pradesh is said to be one of the oldest continually inhabited places in the
            world.
            It is one of the best and most popular travel destinations in UP. Sitting on the bank of River Ganges,
            Varanasi
            is known for its ghats and the winding lanes dotted with temples that come in all sizes and shapes. Haunt of
            Shiva devotees and home to some bizarrely-dressed sadhus, Varanasi is an absolutely a must visit place in
            Uttar
            Pradesh.

            This is a main ghat in Varanasi on the Ganga River in Uttar Pradesh. It is located
            close
            to
            Vishwanath Temple and is probably the most spectacular ghat. Two Hindu legends are associated with it:
            according
            to one, Brahma created it to welcome Shiva, and in another, Brahma sacrificed ten horses during
            Dasa-Ashwamedha
            yajna performed here.
            The present ghat was built by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao in the year 1748. A few decades later, Ahilyabahi
            Holkar,
            the Queen of Indore rebuilt the ghat in the year 1774.Close to the ghat, overlooking the Ganga lies the
            Jantar Mantar, an observatory built by Maharaja Jai Singh of Jaipur in the year 1737.

            It is every pious man's go-to destination to feel overwhelmed by the presence
            and
            power of the great Lord Shiva. Not only is it located in the heart of the cultural capital of India -
            Varanasi,
            but its divinity is multiplied by the holy river Ganga that flows by its side. Banaras Hindu University is
            hence
            home to one of the biggest tourist attractions in the city of Varanasi, the grand New Vishwanath Temple.
            Visiting this temple gives the worshipper the space to put himself in the hands of God, at his disposition,
            and
            listen to the voice in his heart.
            The peace and calm of the temple help you forget the distractions of daily life. The very famous Jyotirlinga
            of
            Shiva,
            Vishweshwara, is believed to have immense and unending power. A single glance of this Jyotirlinga has the
            ability to cleanse our soul and set us on the true path of knowledge and devotion.
            Although primarily a Lord Shiva temple, this beautiful temple consists of nine other temples within one and
            invites people of every faith to bask in its grandeur; using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of
            Hinduism. The New Vishwanath Temple incorporates every element of the Hindu cosmos- the good, the evil and
            the
            human; thus implying the major role that Dharma, Kama, Artha, Moksa and Karma play in our life.

            It is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located in
            Vishwanath
            Gali
            of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh in India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is
            one
            of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The main deity is known by the names Shri
            Vishwanath
            and Vishweshwara (IAST: Vishveshvara or Vishveshvur) literally meaning Lord of the Universe. Varanasi was
            called
            Kashi ("shining") in ancient times, and hence the temple is popularly called Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
            The temple is considered a central part of worship in the Shaiva culture by Hindu scriptures. It had been
            demolished by many Muslim rulers many times, most recently by Aurangzeb, the sixth Mughal emperor who
            constructed the Gyanvapi Mosque on its site.The current structure was built on an adjacent site by the
            Maratha ruler, Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore in the year 1780.
            Since 1983, the temple has been managed by the government of Uttar Pradesh.

            Mother India Temple is located on the Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith
            campus in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. Instead of traditional statues of gods and goddesses, this temple
            has
            a huge
            map of undivided India carved in marble. This temple is dedicated to Bharat Mata and claims to be the only
            one of its kind in the world.

            It is a fortification in Ramnagar, Varanasi, India. It is located near the Ganges on
            its eastern
            bank, opposite to the Tulsi Ghat. The sandstone structure was built in the Mughal style in 1750 by Kashi
            Naresh
            Maharaja Balwant Singh. At present, the fort is not in a good shape. The current king and the resident of
            the
            fort is Anant Narayan Singh, who is also known as the Maharaja of Benares even though this royal title has
            been
            abolished since 1971.
