        <p class="para"> This is a city situated on the banks of holy river Saryu in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
            It
            is the administrative headquarters of the Faizabad district as well as
            the Faizabad division of Uttar Pradesh, India.It shares a municipal corporation with its neighbouring
            twin city of Faizabad. Ayodhya, also known as <i>Saketa</i>, is an ancient city of India, is the
            birthplace of Rama and setting of great epic Ramayana. Ayodhya used to be the capital of the ancient Kosala Kingdom. It has an average
            elevation of 93 meters (305 feet). Owing to the belief as the birthplace of Rama, Ayodhya (Awadhpuri) has been
            regarded as first one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites (Mokshdayini Sapt Puris) for Hindus.
            The early Buddhist and Jain canonical texts mention that the religious leaders Gautama Buddha and
            Mahavira visited and lived in the city. The Jain texts also describe it as the birthplace of five tirthankaras
            namely, Rishabhanatha, Ajitanatha, Abhinandananatha, Sumatinath and Anantnath, and associate it with the
            legend Bharata Chakravarti. From the Gupta period onwards, several sources mention Ayodhya and Saketa as the
            name of the same city Owing to the belief as the birthplace of Ram, Ayodhya has been regarded as one of the seven most
            important pilgrimage sites for Hindus. It is believed that a temple stood at the supposed birth spot of Rama,
            which was demolished by the orders of the Mughal emperor Babur and a mosque erected in its place.In 1992, the
            dispute over the spot led to the demolition of mosque by Hindu mobs, who aimed to rebuild a grand temple of Rama
            at the site. A five-judge full bench of the Supreme Court heard the title cases from August to October 2019
            and ruled that the land belonged to the government per tax records, and ordered it to be handed over to a
            trust to build a Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give an alternative 5 acres of land to the
            Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to build a mosque in lieu of the demolished Babri mosque. The
            construction of Ram Mandir commenced in August 2020.

            The temple of Nageshwarnath was established by Kush, son of Rama. Legend has it that Kush lost his armlet
            while
            bathing in the Sarayu, and it was retrieved by a Nag-Kanya who fell in love with him. As she was a devotee
            of
            Shiva, Kush built her this temple. It was the only temple to survive when Ayodhya was abandoned until the
            time
            of Vikramaditya. While the rest of city was in ruin and covered by dense forest, this temple allowed
            Vikramaditya to recognise the city. The festival of Shivratri is celebrated here with great splendor.

            There is a series of ghats on the bank of River Saryu in Ayodhya in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. A
            large
            number of pilgrims visit every day to take a sacred bath in holy Saryu waters. The river front brings forth
            a
            majestic landscape specially in floodlit night. There were enormous bathing ghats throughout the banks of
            the
            holy river Sarayu and the ones at Nayaghat were immersed in the heavy rains and floods. These were rebuilt
            in
            1985. On occasion of Deepawali in 2019 Ayodhya created Guinness record by lighting 450,000 diyas on Ram ki
            Paidi.
